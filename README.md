## Overview

### The challenge

I challenged myself to make this design to practice what I've learned about HTML5 and CSS3 so far,  
I most especially wanted to ingrain my knowledge about:
* Responsiveness and Media queries
* Positioning in CSS
* Grid and Flexbox layout
* The use of Pseudoselectors
* Semantic HTML

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid and Flexbox Layout

### What I learned

I majorly learnt how to style a website into sections using CSS grid layout and I was able to broaden my html and css skills through this practice.
I still have more to learn but this project pushed me and I've acquired even more knowledge than when I started out.
